# What is the point of this?
This is a test to see if JavaScript and HTML can power a domain host.
# Can I register my own domain?
For various extreme safety reasons i am not accepting other registrations than my own.
# What does "HL" stand for?
The abbreviation "HL" can stand for many things, in this case, since i am a Valve fan, it stands for Half-Life. This project is not affiliated with Valve.
# Can i fork this project to make my own TLD?
no, you may not fork this project as 1. this is a test and 2. if someone just blatently copies my project and puts the website online for people to make their own domains then someone could be harmed from scams and i really do not want that so if you fork it anyway, then i will request you to take it down and never fork it again.
